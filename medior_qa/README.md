# QA Engineer Challenge

As a QA Engineer, one should be able to explore and understand application functionality, recommend automation strategies and automate different types of tests.

## First Challenge (Exploratory Testing)

Create a free account here https://trello.com/. It is used for collaborative work across team members. You can create Boards, lists and tasks/cards.

On the first challenge, do an exploratory testing of "Lists" and create a test session report. You can use any format for session documentation.

### Considerations
- Include all sections that are part of the session report and try to include something in each based on your exploratory testing session

## Second Challenge (Create Test case)

Write your test cases in Gherkin language only for the list title field and text

### Considerations
- Write optimium test cases but achieve maximum feature coverage

## Third Challenge (UI Test Automation)

On the third challenge, you need to perform a UI automation of two test cases from your task # 2

### Considerations
- You can use any tool/framework for the automation (preferably Nightwatchjs)
- Setup a modular/scalable structure for your project

## Lastly

Document the project, **how to run the tests**.

The README file should have all the steps to set up the project locally. Remember that the less commands we have for setting up the project, the better it will be.

After you have the documentation, create a repository in GitLab/Github/Bitbucket and send us the link of the repository in reply to the email

The time estimated for the project is between 1 and 5 hours if you feel that will take more you can cut corners, and document what you could have done differently. 

We will try our best to give you feedback as fast as possible.
